<!-- TODO: 
 In a production environment other than GitHub Pages, you'd typically handle routing with 
 server-side configuration. Instead of using a 404.html with redirects, you'd configure your 
 web server (like Nginx, Apache, or a Node.js backend) to route all requests to your index.html, 
 allowing the client-side React Router to handle navigation.
